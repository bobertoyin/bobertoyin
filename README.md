# Howdy, I'm Robert 👋🤠

I'm a computer science major at Northeastern University 🐾. After taking various courses and spending nine months as a co-op with the Release Engineering 🏗 team at [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com/), I've become somewhat of a jack of all trades from code writing 📝 to shipment 🚢. Most of my development experience has been in Python, but I aim to be as language-agnostic as possible when it comes to solving problems.

When I'm not groaning at Python code or CI/CD builds, I enjoy spending my time cooking 🥘, scuffing up my joints on a skateboard 🛹, or binge-consuming mechanical keyboard content ⌨️.

## Current Status 📍
