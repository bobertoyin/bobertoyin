# Howdy, Robert Here 👋🤠

I'm a computer science major at Northeastern University 🐾. After taking various courses and spending nine months as a co-op with the Release Engineering team at Wayfair, I've become somewhat of a jack of all trades from code writing 📝 to shipment 🚢.

When I'm not groaning at Python code or CI/CD builds, I enjoy spending my time cooking psuedo-fusion cuisine 🌯 or scuffing up my joints on a skateboard 🛹.

## Current Status

I'm currently gearing up to joining [Morse CORP](https://www.morsecorp.com/) 🐉 as a Python SWE co-op for the Spring 2022 semester.
