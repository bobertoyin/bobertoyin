# Howdy, I'm Robert 👋🤠

I'm a computer science major at Northeastern University. After taking various courses and spending nine months as a co-op with the Release Engineering team at [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com/), I've become somewhat of a jack of all trades from code writing to shipment. Most of my development experience has been in Python, but I am always open to learning new tools as a developer.

When I'm not groaning at Python code or CI/CD builds, I enjoy spending my time cooking, scuffing up my joints on a skateboard, or binge-consuming mechanical keyboard content.
